Hippomaps🍤
=====================================
This is a toolbox and repository for open source mapping and contextualization of hippocampal data, paralleling surface-based mapping of the neocortex. This is partnered with a repository of mapped data at [OSF](https://osf.io/92p34/).


Documentation📝
-------------------------------------

See [here](https://hippomaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for installation instructions, details on all tools provided, and tutorial walkthroughs. 

Overview👁️
-------------------------------------

HippoMaps provides tools for mapping data the folded and unfolded hippocampus are designed to work seamlessly with outputs generated by [HippUnfold](https://github.com/khanlab/hippunfold/).

In the [tutorials](https://github.com/jordandekraker/hippomaps/tree/master/tutorials/), we provide examples for mapping:

- laminar ex-vivo histology at the microscale
- structural MRI at 3T and 7T
- resting state fMRI properties and connectivity 
- spatially scattered intracranial EEG (iEEG) recodings
- task-fMRI data mapping with [nilearn](https://nilearn.github.io/stable/)
- comparison between maps and dimensionality reduction

These tutorials provide clear examples of how the tools here can be used, but for shorter examples and usage notes, see also [demos](https://github.com/jordandekraker/hippomaps/tree/master/hippomaps/demos/).
