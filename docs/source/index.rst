Welcome to Hippomaps' documentation!
===================================

**Hippomaps** is a toolbox and repository for open source mapping and contextualization of hippocampal data, paralleling surface-based mapping of the neocortex. This is partnered with a repository of mapped data at https://osf.io/92p34/.

Tools for mapping data the folded and unfolded hippocampus are designed to work seamlessly with outputs generated by HippUnfold. In the tutorials, we provide examples for mapping:

laminar ex-vivo histology at the microscale
structural MRI at 3T and 7T
resting state fMRI properties and connectivity
spatially scattered intracranial EEG (iEEG) recodings
task-fMRI data mapping with nilearn
comparison between maps and dimensionality reduction
These tutorials provide clear examples of how the tools here can be used, but for shorter examples and usage notes, see also demos.
