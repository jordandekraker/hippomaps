Freesurfer subfield atlas

Generated using workflow from https://github.com/khanlab/hippunfold-create-atlas#freesurfer
This creates probalistic and maxprob (used here) labels by running hippunfold & freesurfer subfield segmentation on ds002168 (openneuro, 48 subjects) and mapping the freesurfer labels to the unfolded space.
